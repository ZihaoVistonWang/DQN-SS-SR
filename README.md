# DQN-SV-SR: a DQN-based dynamic replenishment approach considering seasonal variations and shaped reward

This is the code repository for the paper titled "IoT-driven Dynamic Replenishment of Fresh Produce in the Presence of Seasonal Variations: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach using Reward Shaping." Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4516633 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4516633

Currently, the repository is in the **initialization** phase. Upon publication of the paper, all models and experimental code will be expeditiously shared here.
